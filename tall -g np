       npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.

       It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases.  Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

       Run nnppmm hheellpp to get a list of available commands.

       npm is configured to use npm, Inc.'s public registry at https://registry.npmjs.org by default. Use of the npm public registry is subject to terms of use available at https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms.

       You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even run your own registry. Use of someone else's registry may be governed by their terms of use.

       You probably got npm because you want to install stuff.

       Use nnppmm iinnssttaallll bblleerrgg to install the latest version of "blerg".  Check out npm help nnppmm--iinnssttaallll for more info.  It can do a lot of stuff.

       Use the nnppmm sseeaarrcchh command to show everything that's available.  Use nnppmm llss to show everything you've installed.

       If a package references to another package with a git URL, npm depends on a preinstalled git.

       If  one  of  the  packages  npm  tries  to  install  is  a  native  node  module  and  requires  compiling of C++ Code, npm will use node-gyp _h_t_t_p_s_:_/_/_g_i_t_h_u_b_._c_o_m_/_T_o_o_T_a_l_l_N_a_t_e_/_n_o_d_e_-_g_y_p for that task.

       See npm help 5 nnppmm--ffoollddeerrss to learn about where npm puts stuff.

       In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

       · global mode: npm installs packages into the install prefix at pprreeffiixx//lliibb//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess and bins are installed in pprreeffiixx//bbiinn.

       · local mode: npm installs packages into the current project directory, which defaults to the current working directory.  Packages are installed to ..//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess, and bins are installed to ..//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess//..bbiinn.

       Local mode is the default.  Use --gg or ----gglloobbaall on any command to operate in global mode instead.

       If you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the following help topics:

       · json: Make a package.json file.  See npm help 5 ppaacckkaaggee..jjssoonn.

       · link: For linking your current working code into Node's path, so that you don't have to reinstall every time you make a change.  Use nnppmm lliinnkk to do this.

       · install: It's a good idea to install things if you don't need the symbolic link.  Especially, installing other peoples code from the registry is done via nnppmm iinnssttaallll

       · adduser: Create an account or log in.  Credentials are stored in the user config file.

       · publish: Use the nnppmm ppuubblliisshh command to upload your code to the registry.

       npm is extremely configurable.  It reads its configuration options from 5 places.

       · Command  line  switches: Set a config with ----kkeeyy vvaall.  All keys take a value, even if they are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what the options are at the time of parsing).  If no value is provided, then the option
         is set to boolean ttrruuee.

       · Environment Variables: Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with nnppmm__ccoonnffiigg__.  For example, eexxppoorrtt nnppmm__ccoonnffiigg__kkeeyy==vvaall.

       · User Configs: The file at $HOME/.npmrc is an ini-formatted list of configs.  If present, it is parsed.  If the uusseerrccoonnffiigg option is set in the cli or env, then that will be used instead.

       · Global Configs: The file found at ../etc/npmrc (from the node executable, by default this resolves to /usr/local/etc/npmrc) will be parsed if it is found.  If the gglloobbaallccoonnffiigg option is set in the cli, env, or user  config,
         then that file is parsed instead.

       · Defaults: npm's default configuration options are defined in lib/utils/config-defs.js.  These must not be changed.

       See npm help 7 nnppmm--ccoonnffiigg for much much more information.
